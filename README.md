### Build with
---
* [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org) - v2.5.1 (Visual C++ 15 (2017) - 64-bit)

### Music and textures
---
The music and the textures were created with the usage of programs:
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org)
* [LMMS](https://lmms.io)

### Compilation and running
---
I coded and tested the project in Visual Studio 2019.

**Visual Studio 2019:**  
Add dependices to the following SFML libraries:

| Debug mode | Release mode |
| ---- | ---- |
|sfml-window-d.lib|sfml-window.lib|
|sfml-main-d.lib|sfml-main.lib|
|sfml-system-d.lib|sfml-system.lib|
|sfml-graphics-d.lib|sfml-graphics.lib|
|sfml-audio-d.lib|sfml-audio.lib|

Add additional include directiory:
```
SFML-2.5.1\include
```
After compilation copy SFML's .dll files (SFML-2.5.1/bin) into the folder with executable file.

The more detailed instruction is on the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/) page.
